#Film-Bites!
Our project's title is "Film-Bites!" For this project, we created a website that displays food recipe and movie suggestions based on user input. A user is able to select prefered meal categories and be presented with random recipes based on their choice. A user is also presented with randomly selected currently popular movies. 

#Purpose 
This project gave us experience with using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, a CSS library other than Bootstrap(Materialize), and Server APIs (omdb and themealdb). 

#Usage 
To view our project (and find some new recipes and movies!) simply click the attached link and you'll be able to see the deployed project.
